# What is iocraft?

iocraft is a lightweight dependency injection (DI) container for Vue 3 that leverages the Composition API. It provides a simple and intuitive way to manage services and dependencies in Vue applications.

## Key Features

- **Decorator-based service registration** (`@Register()`)
- **Four service retrieval methods** for different use cases
- **Vue lifecycle hook integration** for services
- **Component context sharing** capabilities
- **Circular dependency handling** via getters
- **Router integration** through the `Nav` helper service

iocraft simplifies dependency management in Vue applications while maintaining reactivity and providing clean separation of concerns between business logic and UI components.
